	<h2>MIAPPE</h2>
  <h4>Minimum Information about A Plant Phenotyping Experiment</h4>
	<p>Plant phenotyping data is diverse, dispersed and increasingly plentiful owing to the application of new automated techniques.  While various initiatives have explored how to describe plant traits (e.g. the <a href="http://browser.planteome.org/amigo/term/TO:0000387#display-lineage-tab">Plant Trait Ontology</a>) and phenotypes, description of the experimental design that provides the context for phenotypic observations is not well-standardized.   A basic description of the materials used and the experiment performed is needed to support data discovery and data mining applications.  MIAPPE – the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment – is in development to address these needs.</p>

  <p>MIAPPE is a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n8/full/nbt.1411.html">Minimum Information (MI)</a> standard for plant phenotyping.  It defines a list of attributes that might be necessary to fully describe a phenotyping experiment, following <a href="http://fged.org/projects/miame/">the model originally established for microarray data</a>. Not all of the elements listed in an MI must be reported in each case – it is up to the researcher to decide what is meaningful to interpretation of the results and potential replication of the research. A Minimum Information document should rather be considered as a checklist, and consulted by a person describing or depositing the data in order to include all the important data characteristics.</p>
