# About
An implementation of the [EBI-Boilerplate-Jekyll] (https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Boilerplate-Jekyll) 

## How to add and edit content
To modify content, just edit the .html files at the root — note that they’re in the special jekyll format: https://github.com/pkersey/miappe/tree/gh-pages

The ones to note are:
- index.html
- developers.html
- projects.html

Couple more notes:
- To add a new page, just clone one of the above and edit as appropriate. 
- If you don’t want a page in the menu tabs, remove the bit: group: "in_local_navigation”
- To change the page order, modify: order: 1

When you’re ready to publish to the greate web,  map your domain name to the site — these directions are a good bit more straightforward than the GitHub docs: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/github-with-custom-domain/
